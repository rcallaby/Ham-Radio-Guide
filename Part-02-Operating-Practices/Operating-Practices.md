# Week 2 — Student Chapter: Operating Practices & Safety (Technician-level)

## 1 — Calling procedures (how to make contact on the air)

When you want to contact another amateur station, follow a standard, short format.

### General call procedure (simple two-step):

1. Say **the call sign of the station you want to reach**, followed by **your own call sign**.

   * Example: *“W1AW, this is KJ7ABC.”*
2. If you are calling anyone, use “CQ”: *“CQ CQ CQ, this is KJ7ABC calling CQ and standing by.”*

* **CQ** means you’re calling for any station listening.
* Keep calls short (a few repetitions) and identify with your call sign.

**FCC rule reminder:** You must identify with your call sign at the **end of each contact** and at least every **10 minutes** during a contact.

## 2 — Phonetics (why and how to use them)

Radio conditions aren’t always clear. To spell out words, names, or call signs, amateurs use the **ITU phonetic alphabet** (standardized worldwide).

### Standard Phonetic Alphabet for Ham Radio (Letters)

| Letter | Phonetic Word | Pronunciation |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| A      | Alpha         | al-fah        |

### Standard Phonetic Pronunciations for Numerals in Ham Radio

| Digit | Phonetic Word | Pronunciation |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 0     | Zero          | zee-ro        |
| 1     | One           | wun           |
| 2     | Two           | too           |
| 3     | Three         | tree          |
| 4     | Four          | fow-er        |
| 5     | Five          | fife          |
| 6     | Six           | six           |
| 7     | Seven         | sev-en        |
| 8     | Eight         | ait           |
| 9     | Nine          | nin-er        |

This is the NATO/ITU phonetic system, which is the standard encouraged by the FCC for clarity in amateur radio communications.

**Always use standard phonetics.** Don’t invent your own. It avoids confusion and is the format used worldwide.

## 3 — Using repeaters (the Technician’s bread-and-butter)

Most new Technician operators get on the air using **local VHF or UHF repeaters**.

### What a repeater does:

* Listens on one frequency (input) and transmits what it hears on another (output).
* Usually located on towers, tall buildings, or mountains to provide wide-area coverage.

### Key concepts:

* **Offset**: The difference between transmit and receive frequency (common: ±600 kHz on 2m; ±5 MHz on 70cm).
* **PL/CTCSS tones**: Some repeaters require a sub-audible tone (like a “key”) to access. Program your radio with the correct tone.
* **Etiquette**:

  * Listen before transmitting (don’t interrupt).
  * Identify your call when you key up: *“This is KJ7ABC, monitoring.”*
  * Pause a second before speaking (repeaters have a delay).
  * Leave short breaks between transmissions so others (especially emergency traffic) can break in.

**Lab session exercise:** Instructor demonstrates a call on a repeater with a handheld. Students practice saying: *“This is [your call sign], monitoring.”*

## 4 — Nets (structured group communications)

A **net** is an organized, on-air meeting run by a **net control station (NCS)**.

### Two main types of nets:

1. **Directed nets** (formal):

   * All communication goes through net control.
   * Used for emergency operations, traffic handling, and drills.
   * You check in when called, or by announcing: *“This is KJ7ABC, requesting permission to check in.”*
2. **Informal nets** (ragchew/social nets):

   * Less structured, but still courteous.

**Why nets matter:** You’ll likely join weekly local club nets to practice and meet the community. During emergencies, nets are the backbone of coordination.

## 5 — Logging and record-keeping

* **Is logging required by the FCC?** Not anymore for most casual operation. But…
* **Why log anyway?**

  * For contests, awards (like Worked All States).
  * For troubleshooting (e.g., antenna tests).
  * For emergency drills (proof of communications).
* **What to log:** Date/time (UTC), frequency, mode, other station’s call, signal report, and notes.
* **Tools:** Paper logbooks, spreadsheets, or software (e.g., N3FJP, Ham Radio Deluxe).

**Student activity:** Instructor shows a sample logbook entry. Students practice logging a mock contact.

## 6 — Emergency communications (Amateur Radio at its best)

* **Role of amateurs:** Provide communications when normal infrastructure fails (storms, disasters).
* **FCC rules:** In emergencies **involving the immediate safety of human life or protection of property**, you may use **any frequency or mode necessary**, even outside amateur bands. (Part 97.403–97.405).
* **Organizations:** ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service), RACES (Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service), Skywarn.
* **On-air behavior in emergencies:** Listen, follow net control, keep transmissions short, and pass only necessary info.

---

## 7 — Contest basics

Contesting = on-air competition to make as many contacts as possible under certain rules.

* **Common contests:** ARRL Field Day, CQ Worldwide, Sweepstakes.
* **Why learn as a Technician?** Even if you have limited HF privileges, you can still participate (often via clubs, VHF contests, or as a “GOTA” — Get On The Air — station).
* **Basic exchange:** Call sign, signal report, contest-specific info (like state, section, or serial number).
* **Skills gained:** Fast operating, logging discipline, accuracy.

## 8 — Station grounding and electrical safety

Safety is just as important as operating skills.

### Electrical safety basics:

* Always disconnect gear before working on it.
* Use proper fuses and circuit breakers.
* Treat all exposed wiring as live.
* Avoid “cheater plugs” — always use grounded outlets.

### Grounding:

* Protects against electrical shock and lightning.
* Use a good station ground:

  * Ground rod outside (copper-clad steel, 8 ft recommended).
  * Heavy copper wire to equipment.
  * Keep leads as short and straight as possible.

**FCC Part 97 requires stations to be designed with safety in mind.**

## 9 — RF exposure basics (important FCC rule)

The FCC requires every amateur station to **evaluate RF exposure** and operate within safe limits.

### Simple guidelines:

* **Safe distance**: Don’t place antennas where people are close to the radiating element.
* **Power levels**: Lower power reduces RF risk (use the “minimum necessary” to make contact).
* **Frequency matters**: Higher frequencies generally require more caution because they are absorbed differently by the body.
* **Tools:** The ARRL and FCC provide calculators to estimate safe distances.

**Example rule of thumb:** Keep at least several feet away from a VHF/UHF antenna while transmitting at higher power (25W+).

## 10 — Lab session (hands-on practice)

* **Repeater demo:** Instructor demonstrates making a call on a local repeater with a handheld radio.
* **Student activity:** Students practice keying up, saying call sign clearly, and releasing with a pause.
* **Net etiquette drill:** Students role-play a directed net, rotating as net control and check-in stations.
* **Safety show-and-tell:** Instructor displays grounding wire, coax, lightning arrestor, and explains safe antenna placement.

## 11 — Quick “cheat sheet” (memorize these facts)

* Always call: **their call first, then yours.**
* Use **standard ITU phonetics** (Alfa, Bravo, Charlie…).
* On repeaters: remember **offsets, tones, short pauses, courtesy.**
* In nets: **directed nets → all traffic via net control.**
* FCC requires **RF exposure evaluation** for every station.
* **Ground your station** with proper rods/wire.
* In emergencies: may use **any frequency/mode necessary** for immediate safety.
