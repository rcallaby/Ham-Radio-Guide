# Week 1 — Student Chapter: Introduction to Amateur Radio & FCC Rules (Technician-level)

## 1 — What is “amateur radio”? (short, plain-language intro)

Amateur radio (often called “ham radio”) is a radio service and community where licensed operators use allocated radio frequencies for noncommercial communication, technical experimentation, public service, and friendly contacts with other operators. Licenses are issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and come in several classes; you’ll start as a Technician for most new licenses. ([ARRL][1])

---

## 2 — License classes and Technician privileges (clear summary)

* **Three main U.S. license classes (common to new applicants):**
  **Technician**, **General**, and **Amateur Extra**. Each higher class gives additional operating privileges. Memorize these three names — they appear frequently in questions. ([ncvec.org][7])

* **Technician privileges (what you can do):**

  * **Full privileges on amateur bands above 30 MHz** (VHF, UHF, and microwave bands). That means you can use the very popular 2-meter band (≈144–148 MHz), 70 cm (≈430–450 MHz in the U.S.), local repeaters, many digital modes, satellite operation, and lots of local & regional activity. ([ARRL][1])
  * **Limited HF (shortwave) privileges.** Technicians have a few phone (voice) and CW privileges on HF bands (for example parts of 10 meters and some CW-only segments elsewhere). For the precise band segments, see the official band charts or the FCC/ARRL frequency allocation resources. ([ARRL][8])

**Student tip:** For practical ham life, Technician privileges let you get on the air quickly with a small handheld radio and local repeaters — that’s how many people start.

---

## 3 — The Technician exam (Element 2): format and where the questions come from

* **Format:** The Technician test is **Element 2**, a **35-question multiple-choice exam**. To pass you must correctly answer **26 out of 35** (about 74%). Practice tests use the same format; make sure you can reliably score ≥80% on practice tests before testing. ([Federal Communications Commission][2])
* **Where the questions come from:** The question sets are drawn from the **NCVEC question pool (Element 2)**. The NCVEC maintains the pools and releases them publicly; exam pools are valid for a multi-year cycle, and VEs draw exam questions from the published pool. ([ncvec.org][7])

**Student tip:** Study using a current question-pool aware tool (HamStudy, HamExam, ARRL practice tests). The pool contains not just text questions but also graphics/diagrams that may appear on the test.

---

## 4 — Station identification: the plain rule and usable examples

**Rule in simple terms:** Every time you transmit you must make it clear who is transmitting. Concretely: **you must transmit your assigned call sign at the end of each communication, and at least once every 10 minutes while the communication continues.** No unidentified transmissions are allowed. ([eCFR][3])

**Why this matters:** The rule ensures listeners can identify the source of any transmission quickly. It’s short and practical — memorize “end of communication + every 10 minutes”.

**How to say it (examples you can use on the air):**

* Phone (voice):

  * After a short QSO: “Thanks for the contact — KJ7ABC, clear.”
  * Mid-long contact every 10 minutes: include the call sign naturally: “KJ7ABC monitoring” or “This is KJ7ABC.” ([eCFR][3])
* CW (Morse): send your call sign (e.g., “K J 7 A B C”) per normal CW practice. ([eCFR][3])
* Digital (RTTY/PSK/FT8): include your call in the standard format used for that mode and repeat per the timing rules. ([eCFR][3])

**Student exercise:** Practice saying your call sign clearly and ending a QSO with it (in the classroom do a short role-play).

## 5 — Who’s responsible on the air? (licensee & control operator explained)

* **Station licensee (the person or club the license is issued to)** is legally responsible for the station’s proper operation. If someone else is acting as the control operator, **both** the licensee and the control operator are equally responsible for compliance with FCC rules. That means if you let someone else operate your station, you share responsibility for what they do on-air. ([eCFR][4])

* **Control operator** is the person who is in immediate control of transmissions. The control operator must **ensure the station is operating properly** and must only operate to the extent permitted by that operator’s license class. If a control operator exceeds their privileges (e.g., transmits on a band they aren’t allowed to use), the control operator and the licensee can both be held responsible. ([eCFR][9])

**Classroom scenario:** If you loan a friend your rig and they transmit on phone on a band they’re not authorized for, both you (as licensee) and your friend (as the control operator) may be in violation. Always check privileges before letting someone else operate your station.

---

## 6 — Prohibited transmissions (the common “don’ts”)

The FCC lists certain transmissions that **may not** be made on amateur stations. The important, exam-relevant items students see again and again are:

* **No communications for hire or material compensation.** You may not transmit messages in exchange for payment (direct or indirect), except for a few limited exceptions listed in the rules. ([Legal Information Institute][5])
* **No broadcasting (one-way transmissions intended for the general public).** Amateur service is two-way; you may not use it like a broadcast station. ([eCFR][3])
* **No transmissions that are obscene, indecent, or intended to harass.**
* **Restrictions on automatic retransmission** (repeaters/auxiliary stations are allowed in specific ways, but you can’t automatically retransmit non-amateur broadcast programs). ([Legal Information Institute][5])

**Student tip:** On the exam, a question that mentions “paid advertisement on-air” is almost always testing §97.113 (prohibited transmissions) — answer: prohibited.

---

## 7 — License term and renewal (simple facts)

* **License term:** An amateur license is **normally issued for 10 years**. Memorize “10 years.” ([eCFR][6])
* **Expired license — filing grace period:** If your license expires, you may apply for renewal during a **2-year filing grace period**; the rules explain how and when that must be done. Practically, don’t let your license lapse; use the FCC License Manager/ULS to renew in time. ([eCFR][10])

**Student tip:** Set a calendar reminder for renewal well before the expiration date. Create and associate your FCC CORES/FRN account early so renewal is simple. ([FCC Applications][11])

---

## 8 — Before the exam: get your FRN (step-by-step)

You will need an **FCC Registration Number (FRN)**. Many VE teams will ask for it when you apply.

**How to get it (short how-to):**

1. Go to the FCC CORES / Registration System (CORES). ([FCC Applications][11])
2. Create a username and password (follow on-site prompts). The system will generate your FRN. Keep the FRN safe — it’s the number used by the FCC to track your application and license. ([FCC Applications][12])
3. If you already had an FRN from a previous license, link it to your CORES username (ARRL and the FCC have short guides). ([ARRL][13])

**If you don’t have an FRN on exam day:** Many VE teams will help you find or create one, but it’s best to obtain it ahead of time to speed the process. ([ARRL][14])

---

## 9 — At a VE session: the practical steps (what to bring and expect)

* **Before the session:** Check local VE listings (ARRL VEC and local clubs publish exam schedules). Pre-register if required. ([ARRL][15])
* **Bring to the session:** Photo ID, FRN (if you have one), any required fees (commonly around $15 but check the VE listing), and a completed NCVEC **Form 605** if the VE team provides it for pre-fill. Many VE teams will provide or accept the NCVEC Quick-Form 605 at the session. ([ARRL][16])
* **Testing format:** Exams are commonly administered on paper or via approved electronic systems. You will mark answers on the official answer sheet; VEs score tests at the session. ([wcars-vec.org][17])

**What happens if you pass:** The VE team completes the session paperwork (NCVEC Form 605) and the VEC forwards the successful applicant data to the FCC for processing. After processing, your license and call sign appear in the FCC ULS / License Manager and you can look up the call sign there. ([ARRL][16])

---

## 10 — After you pass: check your license and what’s next

* **Check License Manager / ULS**: Use the FCC ULS License Search or the License Manager to find your call sign (search by FRN, name, or call sign). The ARRL and FCC both keep instructions for this. ([wireless2.fcc.gov][18])
* **Start operating:** Use your Technician privileges: join local repeater nets, try a handheld on the local repeater, learn about digital modes, and get comfortable with on-air etiquette. Consider joining a local club for mentoring. ([ARRL][1])

## 11 — In-class practice activities you can do right away

1. **FRN workshop:** Have each student create an FCC CORES account and record their FRN (follow the instructor step-by-step). ([FCC Applications][11])
2. **Station ID role-play:** Two students simulate a 2-minute QSO; practice ending with correct call sign and inserting the 10-minute ID if the conversation continues. ([eCFR][3])
3. **Responsibility scenarios:** Instructor reads scenarios (guest operator, paid messages, unattended transmission) and students identify the rule and the correct action. ([Legal Information Institute][5])

---

## 12 — Quick “cheat sheet” — top facts to memorize

* Technician / General / Amateur Extra are the three license classes. ([ncvec.org][7])
* Technician test = **35 multiple-choice questions; pass is 26 correct**. ([Federal Communications Commission][2])
* Station ID: **call sign at end of every communication and at least every 10 minutes during a continuous communication**. ([eCFR][3])
* License term = **10 years**; expired license may be renewed during a **2-year filing grace period**. ([eCFR][6])
* **Licensee and control operator are both responsible** for proper operation if they differ. ([eCFR][4])
